A simple Hotel reservations app i made for my C# final project 

It uses the entity model sql and Linq to allow you too write read and update hotel reservations.

I recently updated it to utilized SQLite which is a selfcontainted SQL database so that way the user didnt have to have sql server installed on there PC to get the app to run.
