This is a simple bug tracking software i made based off a ASP.NET project i
did at school.

Its features are:     Report issues with descriptions,issue type,priority,etc.

	View all issues current issues colour coded by issue
	priority(acknowleded,open,resolved,closed)

	Filter issues based on one or many criteria in any of the fields

	Edit preview issues and stores logs of changes to any issue.

	Compatible with all sized devices as well as any device running android
	2.2 or greater thanks to the utlization of a library called
	ActionBarSherlock which gives compaitiblity support for older versions of
	android with my action bars and the tabed layout.

	DRM free!


It stores all data on a local database so if the app is deleted the database
will be lost

The app isnt ment to be actualy used by anybody for actual software
development but was just ment as  a way for me to understand android and gave
me a project were i could focus more on actualy learning how to program
android and not have to worry about coming up with an idea for a project aside
from figuring out how to get my desktop app to fit nicely on too a phone sized
screen.
