one of the first coding projects i did when i started learning to program

I didn't write the javascript slideshow but had to hack apart one i found online to get it too work how i wanted and format how i wanted 

the website is very bare beacuse all the text and pictures they gave me is all the info i had too work with so i had to try and make the website work with such little content.
